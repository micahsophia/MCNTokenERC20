# MCN Token - Create and Mint ERC20 Token 

## Overview
MiCoin (MCN) is an Ethereum-based ERC20 token designed for various purposes within the blockchain ecosystem. This smart contract implements the ERC20 standard with added functionalities such as minting, burning, and transferring tokens. MCN tokens can be used for various decentralized applications and digital transactions.

## Features
- **Standard ERC20**: Implements the standard ERC20 interface for compatibility with other tokens and platforms.
- **Minting**: Allows the contract owner to create and issue new tokens to specified addresses.
- **Burning**: Enables token holders to burn (destroy) their tokens, reducing the total supply.
- **Transferring**: Supports transferring tokens between Ethereum addresses.
- **Owner Control**: Ensures that only the contract owner can execute minting functions.

## Getting Started
1. **Deployment**: Deploy the `MiCoin` contract to the Ethereum blockchain. Ensure that you provide the initial supply of MCN tokens during deployment.
2. **Interacting with the Contract**: After deployment, you can interact with the contract through various Ethereum wallet interfaces like Remix IDE, MetaMask, or Web3.js. Use the provided functions to mint, burn, and transfer tokens as needed.

## Usage Examples

### Mint Tokens
The `mint` function allows the contract owner to create and issue new MCN tokens to a specified Ethereum address. 

### Burn Tokens
Token holders can use the `burn` function to destroy their own MCN tokens, reducing the total supply. 

### Transfer Tokens
The `transfer` function enables token holders to send MCN tokens to other Ethereum addresses. It includes a balance check to ensure that the sender has sufficient tokens.
